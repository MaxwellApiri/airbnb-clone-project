## 🗃️ Database Design

### Entities and Fields:

#### 1. Users
- `id` (unique identifier)
- `name`
- `email`
- `passwordHash`
- `role` (guest, host)

#### 2. Properties
- `id`
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `pricePerNight`
- `ownerId` (references Users)

#### 3. Bookings
- `id`
- `userId` (references Users)
- `propertyId` (references Properties)
- `startDate`
- `endDate`
- `status`

#### 4. Reviews
- `id`
- `userId`
- `propertyId`
- `rating`
- `comment`

#### 5. Payments
- `id`
- `userId`
- `bookingId`
- `amount`
- `status`

### Relationships:
- A **user** can list multiple **properties**.
- A **booking** belongs to one **user** and one **property**.
- A **review** is made by a **user** for a **property**.
- A **payment** is associated with a **booking** and **user**.

## 🚀 Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Handles sign-up, login, authentication, and user role management (host vs guest).

### Property Management
Allows hosts to list properties with details like title, description, price, and availability.

### Booking System
Guests can browse properties and make bookings for available dates.

### Review System
Users can leave ratings and comments after completing a stay.

### Payment Integration
Handles secure payment processing for bookings.

### Admin Dashboard (Optional)
Provides analytics and management tools for site administrators.

## 🔒 API Security

### Key Security Measures:

- **Authentication**: Ensures that only logged-in users can access protected resources using JWTs.
- **Authorization**: Ensures users only access data they’re allowed to (e.g., only hosts can edit their listings).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of the API (e.g., brute-force login attempts).
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Prevents common attacks like XSS and SQL/NoSQL injection.

### Why It’s Important:
- **Protecting User Data**: Prevents data breaches of personal information.
- **Securing Payments**: Ensures transaction data is protected from tampering.
- **Trust & Reputation**: A secure system builds user trust and maintains platform integrity.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) automates the testing and deployment of code, ensuring rapid and reliable updates.

### Why It’s Important:
- Reduces human error during deployment
- Allows for faster feature delivery
- Automatically tests code before pushing to production

### Tools We Might Use:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates build, test, and deployment pipelines.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the app for consistent environments.
- **Render / Vercel / Netlify / Railway**: For deployment and hosting.

## 🔧 Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
Handles user registration, login, and authentication. Supports different user roles (guests and hosts) to allow personalized access and actions within the app.

### 2. Property Management
Allows hosts to list new properties with details such as title, description, location, images, price, and availability. Hosts can edit or delete their listings and manage them through a dashboard.

### 3. Booking System
Enables guests to browse available properties and make bookings for selected dates. Automatically prevents double-booking and ensures date validation.

### 4. Review System
Guests can rate and review properties after their stay. Reviews help future guests make informed decisions and provide feedback to hosts.

### 5. Payment Integration
Processes booking payments securely using integrated payment services (e.g., Stripe). Ensures transactions are tracked and linked to users and bookings.

### 6. Search and Filtering
Users can search for properties by location, date, price, and type. Filtering improves the user experience by narrowing down relevant results.

### 7. Admin Panel (Optional)
An administrative interface for managing users, listings, and reviewing flagged content. Helps ensure platform quality and security.


## 🔐 API Security

To ensure the safety and reliability of the backend services, several key security measures will be implemented:

### 1. Authentication
We use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to verify user identity. This prevents unauthorized users from accessing protected routes and data.

### 2. Authorization
Role-based access control ensures that only permitted users can perform certain actions. For example, only hosts can list properties, and only admins can delete reviews.

### 3. Rate Limiting
Rate limiting prevents abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given time window. This is useful for protecting against brute-force attacks and service overloads.

### 4. Data Validation and Sanitization
All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent SQL/NoSQL injection, XSS (cross-site scripting), and other malicious inputs.

### Why Security is Crucial:
- **Protecting User Data:** Prevents leaks of personal and sensitive information.
- **Securing Payments:** Ensures that financial transactions are handled securely to protect both users and the platform.
- **Maintaining Platform Trust:** A secure app builds user confidence and protects your reputation.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment**. It refers to the practice of automatically building, testing, and deploying code whenever new changes are pushed to the codebase.

### Why It's Important:
- **Faster Delivery:** Enables frequent updates with confidence, reducing manual work.
- **Error Detection:** Catches bugs early in development through automated testing.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that the deployment process is the same every time, reducing human error.

### Tools Used:
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing and deployment directly from GitHub.
- **Docker:** Containerizes the application, ensuring it runs the same in development and production.
- **Render / Railway / Vercel / Netlify:** Platforms for automatic deployment and hosting.
