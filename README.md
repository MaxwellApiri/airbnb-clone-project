### 6. Mongoose
An ODM (Object Data Modeling) tool to manage schemas and interact with MongoDB easily.

### 7. JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Used for securely managing authentication tokens.

### 8. Git & GitHub
Used for version control and collaborative development.

### 9. Postman
Used for testing API endpoints and backend logic.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

### Entities and Fields:

#### 1. Users
- `id` (unique identifier)
- `name`
- `email`
- `passwordHash`
- `role` (guest, host)

#### 2. Properties
- `id`
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `pricePerNight`
- `ownerId` (references Users)

#### 3. Bookings
- `id`
- `userId` (references Users)
- `propertyId` (references Properties)
- `startDate`
- `endDate`
- `status`

#### 4. Reviews
- `id`
- `userId`
- `propertyId`
- `rating`
- `comment`

#### 5. Payments
- `id`
- `userId`
- `bookingId`
- `amount`
- `status`

### Relationships:
- A **user** can list multiple **properties**.
- A **booking** belongs to one **user** and one **property**.
- A **review** is made by a **user** for a **property**.
- A **payment** is associated with a **booking** and **user**.

## üîí API Security

### Key Security Measures:

- **Authentication**: Ensures that only logged-in users can access protected resources using JWTs.
- **Authorization**: Ensures users only access data they‚Äôre allowed to (e.g., only hosts can edit their listings).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of the API (e.g., brute-force login attempts).
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Prevents common attacks like XSS and SQL/NoSQL injection.

### Why It‚Äôs Important:
- **Protecting User Data**: Prevents data breaches of personal information.
- **Securing Payments**: Ensures transaction data is protected from tampering.
- **Trust & Reputation**: A secure system builds user trust and maintains platform integrity.

## üîÅ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) automates the testing and deployment of code, ensuring rapid and reliable updates.

### Why It‚Äôs Important:
- Reduces human error during deployment
- Allows for faster feature delivery
- Automatically tests code before pushing to production

### Tools We Might Use:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates build, test, and deployment pipelines.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the app for consistent environments.
- **Render / Vercel / Netlify / Railway**: For deployment and hosting.

## üîß Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
Handles user registration, login, and authentication. Supports different user roles (guests and hosts) to allow personalized access and actions within the app.

### 2. Property Management
Allows hosts to list new properties with details such as title, description, location, images, price, and availability. Hosts can edit or delete their listings and manage them through a dashboard.

### 3. Booking System
Enables guests to browse available properties and make bookings for selected dates. Automatically prevents double-booking and ensures date validation.

### 4. Review System
Guests can rate and review properties after their stay. Reviews help future guests make informed decisions and provide feedback to hosts.

### 5. Payment Integration
Processes booking payments securely using integrated payment services (e.g., Stripe). Ensures transactions are tracked and linked to users and bookings.

### 6. Search and Filtering
Users can search for properties by location, date, price, and type. Filtering improves the user experience by narrowing down relevant results.

### 7. Admin Panel (Optional)
An administrative interface for managing users, listings, and reviewing flagged content. Helps ensure platform quality and security.
